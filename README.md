### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an assistant professor in Epidemiology at the [School of Public Health](https://faspa.cayetano.edu.pe/index.php/es/plana-docente-217/27-sobre-faspa/docentes/1203-carrasco-gabriel) and an associate researcher at the [Institute of Tropical Medicine "Alexander von Humboldt"](https://imtavh.cayetano.edu.pe/nosotros/organizacion), both at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH). Currently, I'm the director of the [Health Innovation Lab](https://www.innovalab.info/) and a board member of [CLIMA, the Center for Latin-American Research on Climate Change and Health](https://climaupch.com/directorio/). 

I earned a MS in Epidemiology at the School of Public Health, UPCH and I'm currently a PhD candidate in Public Health at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). My research lies at the interface of infectious diseases epidemiology, human mobility, environmental determinants, climate change, and urban development. I try to use a wide range of methods such as causal inference, spatio-temporal analysis, and remote sensing to forward our understanding of infectious disease dynamics in complex environmental settings.
